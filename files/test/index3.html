Paul Skalnik</span> is a grifter and criminal. Now a man may be executed because of his dubious testimony. Why did prosecutors rely on him as an informant?</p>
</html>

	<p>When detective <span id="mention-6" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention
person" property="mentions" typeof="person" data-label="John Halliday"
data-sort="HallidayJohn">John Halliday</span> paid a visit to the <span
id="mention-7" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place" property="mentions"
typeof="place" data-label="Pinellas County" data-wikidata-id="Q494556">Pinellas
County</span> Jail on <time datetime="1986-12-04">Dec. 4, 1986</time>, his
highest-profile murder case was in trouble. <span id="mention-8"
about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span>, who was 35 and
investigated homicides for the local sheriff’s office, had spent more than a
decade policing <span id="mention-9" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention
place">Pinellas County</span>, a peninsula edged by white-sugar-sand beaches on
<span id="mention-545" about="Florida" class="mention place" property="mentions"
typeof="place" data-label="Florida" data-wikidata-id="Q812">Florida</span>’s
<span id="mention-10" about="GulfCoast" class="mention place"
property="mentions" typeof="place" data-label="Gulf Coast"
data-wikidata-id="Q55241">Gulf Coast</span>, west of <span id="mention-543"
about="Tampa" class="mention place" property="mentions" typeof="place"
data-label="Tampa" data-wikidata-id="Q49255">Tampa</span>. It is a place that
outpaces virtually all other counties in the nation in the number of defendants
it has sentenced to death. Prosecutors who pursued the biggest cases there in
the 1980s relied on <span id="mention-11" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention
person">Halliday</span>, who embodied the county’s law-and-order ethos.
Powerfully built and 6-foot-4, with a mane of dirty blond hair and a tan
mustache, he was skilled at marshaling the facts that prosecutors needed to win
convictions.</p>

	<p>He had worked the case for the past year and a half, ever since the body
of a 14-year-old girl named <span id="mention-12" about="ShellyBoggio"
class="mention person" property="mentions" typeof="person" data-label="Shelly
Boggio">Shelly Boggio</span> was found, nude, floating in an inland waterway
near the town of <span id="mention-13" about="IndianRocksBeach" class="mention
place" property="mentions" typeof="place" data-label="Indian Rocks Beach"
data-wikidata-id="Q992514">Indian Rocks Beach</span>. Her murder was singular in
its violence. Her body bore 31 stab wounds, many of them to her hands, as if she
had tried to shield herself from the ferocity of the attack. She was most likely
still alive, the medical examiner determined, when she was dragged into the
water and left to drown. Her older sister identified her by the silver ring,
eagle-shaped and inset with turquoise, that she wore on her left hand.</p>

	<p>The crime scene yielded few clues. No murder weapon was left behind, and
no fingerprints or other forensic evidence was recovered. If <span
id="mention-14" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span> was
sexually assaulted, the medical examiner found, any trace of sperm may have been
washed away during her time in the water. “It was one of <span id="mention-15"
about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span>’s cruelest
murders,” The <span id="mention-609" about="StPetersburg" class="mention place"
property="mentions" typeof="place" data-label="St. Petersburg"
data-wikidata-id="Q49236">St. Petersburg</span> Times observed, “and there was
little evidence.”</p>

	<p><span id="mention-17" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention
person">Halliday</span>’s investigation quickly zeroed in on two men, <span
id="mention-18" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person" property="mentions"
typeof="person" data-label="Jack Pearcy" data-sort="PearcyJack">Jack
Pearcy</span> and <span id="mention-19" about="JamesDailey" class="mention
person" property="mentions" typeof="person" data-label="James Dailey"
data-sort="DaileyJames">James Dailey</span>, who lived together and were new to
<span id="mention-20" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas
County</span>. The facts, what few there were, pointed overwhelmingly to <span
id="mention-21" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>, a
29-year-old construction worker with a history of arrests for violence against
women. <span id="mention-22" about="JackPearcy" class="mention
person">Pearcy</span> pursued the teenager before her death, and <span
id="mention-23" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> picked
her up on the last afternoon of her life, when she was thumbing a ride with her
twin sister and a friend. The girls spent the afternoon and evening with <span
id="mention-24" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>, <span
id="mention-25" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> and
other housemates, drinking wine coolers and smoking marijuana. After the other
two girls went home, <span id="mention-26" about="JackPearcy" class="mention
person">Pearcy</span> took <span id="mention-27" about="ShellyBoggio"
class="mention person" property="mentions" typeof="person" data-label="Shelly
Boggio" data-sort="BoggioShelly">Boggio</span> to a beachfront bar, where she
was last seen, barefoot and disheveled, around midnight.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-28" about="JackPearcy" class="mention
person">Pearcy</span> acknowledged that he drove her to the lovers’ lane along
the <span id="mention-678" about="IntracoastalWaterway" class="mention place"
property="mentions" typeof="place" data-label="Intracoastal Waterway"
data-wikidata-id="Q756421">Intracoastal Waterway</span> where she was killed.
But he tried to shift blame to <span id="mention-29" about="JamesDailey"
class="mention person">Dailey</span>, claiming that he picked up his housemate
before he and <span id="mention-30" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention
person">Boggio</span> headed down to the water. And while <span id="mention-31"
about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> admitted to the police
that he stabbed <span id="mention-32" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention
person">Boggio</span> at least once, and he provided details about the crime
that were known only to investigators, he insisted that it was <span
id="mention-33" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> who was
the actual killer.</p>

	<p>This was all that connected <span id="mention-34" about="JamesDailey"
class="mention person" property="mentions" typeof="person" data-label="James
Dailey">Dailey</span>, a 38-year-old itinerant <span id="mention-652"
about="Vietnam" class="mention place" property="mentions" typeof="place"
data-label="Vietnam" data-wikidata-id="Q881">Vietnam</span> veteran, to the
crime: the word of its prime suspect. No physical or forensic evidence linked
him to the murder, nor did any discernible motive. He would later say he had
been asleep in the early-morning hours when <span id="mention-35"
about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> was out alone with <span
id="mention-36" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span>, only
to be awaked by <span id="mention-37" about="JackPearcy" class="mention
person">Pearcy</span>, who said he needed to talk; <span id="mention-38"
about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> drove him to a nearby
causeway, where they drank beer and smoked a few joints at the water’s edge.
<span id="mention-39" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>’s
girlfriend and a longtime friend of <span id="mention-40" about="JackPearcy"
class="mention person">Pearcy</span>’s said they saw the two men come home
together that morning, hours before <span id="mention-41" about="ShellyBoggio"
class="mention person">Boggio</span>’s body was found, and that <span
id="mention-42" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s jeans
were wet.</p>

	<p>The state attorney’s office in <span id="mention-43" about="Clearwater"
class="mention place" property="mentions" typeof="place" data-label="Clearwater"
data-wikidata-id="Q244146">Clearwater</span> pressed forward with the most
serious charge it could bring against the men, ensuring that they would be tried
for first-degree murder — a crime punishable by death. <span id="mention-44"
about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>’s trial came first and
ended with a guilty verdict in <time datetime="1986-11">November 1986</time>.
But at the penalty phase, the jury recommended that he be sentenced to life in
prison. It was a blow to the state attorney’s office, which would argue, in a
forceful sentencing memo to the court, that “no evidence exists that <span
id="mention-45" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> was not
the main actor in this child’s brutal murder.” <span id="mention-46"
about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> had dodged the electric
chair after participating in, and most likely carrying out, one of the county’s
most monstrous crimes. Prosecutors had only one more chance to secure a death
sentence for <span id="mention-47" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention
person">Boggio</span>’s murder.</p>
