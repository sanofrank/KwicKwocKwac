	<p>When detective <span id="mention-6" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="John Halliday" data-sort="HallidayJohn">John Halliday</span> paid a visit to the <span id="mention-7" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Pinellas County" data-wikidata-id="Q494556">Pinellas County</span> Jail on <time datetime="1986-12-04">Dec. 4, 1986</time>, his highest-profile murder case was in trouble. <span id="mention-8" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span>, who was 35 and investigated homicides for the local sheriff’s office, had spent more than a decade policing <span id="mention-9" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span>, a peninsula edged by white-sugar-sand beaches on <span id="mention-545" about="Florida" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Florida" data-wikidata-id="Q812">Florida</span>’s <span id="mention-10" about="GulfCoast" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Gulf Coast" data-wikidata-id="Q55241">Gulf Coast</span>, west of <span id="mention-543" about="Tampa" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Tampa" data-wikidata-id="Q49255">Tampa</span>. It is a place that outpaces virtually all other counties in the nation in the number of defendants it has sentenced to death. Prosecutors who pursued the biggest cases there in the 1980s relied on <span id="mention-11" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span>, who embodied the county’s law-and-order ethos. Powerfully built and 6-foot-4, with a mane of dirty blond hair and a tan mustache, he was skilled at marshaling the facts that prosecutors needed to win convictions.</p>

	<p>He had worked the case for the past year and a half, ever since the body of a 14-year-old girl named <span id="mention-12" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Shelly Boggio">Shelly Boggio</span> was found, nude, floating in an inland waterway near the town of <span id="mention-13" about="IndianRocksBeach" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Indian Rocks Beach" data-wikidata-id="Q992514">Indian Rocks Beach</span>. Her murder was singular in its violence. Her body bore 31 stab wounds, many of them to her hands, as if she had tried to shield herself from the ferocity of the attack. She was most likely still alive, the medical examiner determined, when she was dragged into the water and left to drown. Her older sister identified her by the silver ring, eagle-shaped and inset with turquoise, that she wore on her left hand.</p>

	<p>The crime scene yielded few clues. No murder weapon was left behind, and no fingerprints or other forensic evidence was recovered. If <span id="mention-14" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span> was sexually assaulted, the medical examiner found, any trace of sperm may have been washed away during her time in the water. “It was one of <span id="mention-15" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span>’s cruelest murders,” The <span id="mention-609" about="StPetersburg" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="St. Petersburg" data-wikidata-id="Q49236">St. Petersburg</span> Times observed, “and there was little evidence.”</p>

	<p><span id="mention-17" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span>’s investigation quickly zeroed in on two men, <span id="mention-18" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Jack Pearcy" data-sort="PearcyJack">Jack Pearcy</span> and <span id="mention-19" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="James Dailey" data-sort="DaileyJames">James Dailey</span>, who lived together and were new to <span id="mention-20" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span>. The facts, what few there were, pointed overwhelmingly to <span id="mention-21" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>, a 29-year-old construction worker with a history of arrests for violence against women. <span id="mention-22" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> pursued the teenager before her death, and <span id="mention-23" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> picked her up on the last afternoon of her life, when she was thumbing a ride with her twin sister and a friend. The girls spent the afternoon and evening with <span id="mention-24" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>, <span id="mention-25" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> and other housemates, drinking wine coolers and smoking marijuana. After the other two girls went home, <span id="mention-26" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> took <span id="mention-27" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Shelly Boggio" data-sort="BoggioShelly">Boggio</span> to a beachfront bar, where she was last seen, barefoot and disheveled, around midnight.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-28" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> acknowledged that he drove her to the lovers’ lane along the <span id="mention-678" about="IntracoastalWaterway" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Intracoastal Waterway" data-wikidata-id="Q756421">Intracoastal Waterway</span> where she was killed. But he tried to shift blame to <span id="mention-29" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>, claiming that he picked up his housemate before he and <span id="mention-30" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span> headed down to the water. And while <span id="mention-31" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> admitted to the police that he stabbed <span id="mention-32" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span> at least once, and he provided details about the crime that were known only to investigators, he insisted that it was <span id="mention-33" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> who was the actual killer.</p>

	<p>This was all that connected <span id="mention-34" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="James Dailey">Dailey</span>, a 38-year-old itinerant <span id="mention-652" about="Vietnam" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Vietnam" data-wikidata-id="Q881">Vietnam</span> veteran, to the crime: the word of its prime suspect. No physical or forensic evidence linked him to the murder, nor did any discernible motive. He would later say he had been asleep in the early-morning hours when <span id="mention-35" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> was out alone with <span id="mention-36" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span>, only to be awaked by <span id="mention-37" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>, who said he needed to talk; <span id="mention-38" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> drove him to a nearby causeway, where they drank beer and smoked a few joints at the water’s edge. <span id="mention-39" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>’s girlfriend and a longtime friend of <span id="mention-40" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>’s said they saw the two men come home together that morning, hours before <span id="mention-41" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span>’s body was found, and that <span id="mention-42" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s jeans were wet.</p>

	<p>The state attorney’s office in <span id="mention-43" about="Clearwater" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Clearwater" data-wikidata-id="Q244146">Clearwater</span> pressed forward with the most serious charge it could bring against the men, ensuring that they would be tried for first-degree murder — a crime punishable by death. <span id="mention-44" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>’s trial came first and ended with a guilty verdict in <time datetime="1986-11">November 1986</time>. But at the penalty phase, the jury recommended that he be sentenced to life in prison. It was a blow to the state attorney’s office, which would argue, in a forceful sentencing memo to the court, that “no evidence exists that <span id="mention-45" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> was not the main actor in this child’s brutal murder.” <span id="mention-46" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> had dodged the electric chair after participating in, and most likely carrying out, one of the county’s most monstrous crimes. Prosecutors had only one more chance to secure a death sentence for <span id="mention-47" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span>’s murder.</p>

	<p>Ten days after the conclusion of <span id="mention-52" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>’s trial, <span id="mention-53" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span> visited the <span id="mention-54" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span> Jail. At his direction, jailers began pulling inmates who were housed near <span id="mention-55" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> out of their cells. One by one, the men were taken to a small, windowless room, where <span id="mention-56" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span> was waiting. He pressed each man for information. Had <span id="mention-57" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> ever talked about his case? Ever admitted to anything?</p>

	<p>Four men who were questioned that day testified at a 2018 evidentiary hearing to the same unsettling detail in the interview room. Newspaper articles about <span id="mention-58" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span>’s murder were laid out conspicuously before them. “I got a very uneasy feeling looking at the newspaper articles,” <span id="mention-59" about="MichaelSorrentino" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Michael Sorrentino" data-sort="SorrentinoMichael">Michael Sorrentino</span>, one of the four, testified at the hearing. “Had I wanted to say something, or fabricate something, all the tools were there to give them whatever they might be looking for.”</p>

	<p><span id="mention-60" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span> testified at the hearing that there were no newspapers in the interview room. Either way, no one gave <span id="mention-61" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span> any useful information that day. In a slender, lined notebook, the detective recorded what each inmate told him. “Nothing,” he jotted down after one interview. After others, he wrote:</p>

	<blockquote>Said <span id="mention-62" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> denies charge <br>
	doesn’t know a thing  <br>
	Nothing <br>
	Knows nothing. Didn’t even know <span id="mention-63" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>. <br>
	stays to himself. Knows nothing. <br>
	Refused to come to be interviewed. <br>
	“Wish I could have helped you but its a little outa my league.”</blockquote>

	<p><span id="mention-64" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span>’s visit was a bust. But in the <span id="mention-65" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span> Jail, the word was out: The <span id="mention-66" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span> case needed a snitch.</p>

	<p>In jail, it is widely understood that helping prosecutors and the police can earn extraordinary benefits, from reduced sentences to dismissed charges. By the time <span id="mention-67" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s trial began the following summer in <span id="mention-68" about="Clearwater" class="mention place">Clearwater</span>, in <time datetime="1987-06">June 1987</time>, no fewer than three inmates had come forward claiming to have heard <span id="mention-69" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> confess to the killing. The first two worked in the jail’s law library, where they professed to have heard <span id="mention-70" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> say about the murder, “I’m the one that did it.” They also told the jury of ferrying several handwritten notes between <span id="mention-71" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> and <span id="mention-72" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>; in the letters shown to the jury, <span id="mention-73" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> appeared eager to appease his co-defendant, whom prosecutors planned to put on the stand. But the two jailhouse informants were eclipsed by a third inmate, who had contacted <span id="mention-74" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span> to say that he had some information. He told a much more damning story — one that placed <span id="mention-75" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> at the scene of the crime and put the knife in his hand. It was exactly what prosecutors needed.</p>

	<p>That witness was <span id="mention-76" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Paul Skalnik</span>, a familiar figure around the <span id="mention-77" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span> Courthouse. He had appeared before the court numerous times as a jailhouse informant and was skilled at providing the sort of incendiary details that brought a defendant’s guilt into sudden, terrible focus. <span id="mention-78" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> began working with <span id="mention-79" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span> in 1983, when the detective was investigating a triple homicide, and <span id="mention-80" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> helped send two men to death row, cementing his status as an invaluable resource. Because he was a known snitch, he was held in protective custody, in a single cell where he was shielded from inmates who might want to do him harm. Despite this considerable impediment, <span id="mention-81" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> claimed — just a few weeks before jury selection in <span id="mention-82" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s trial began — to have procured <span id="mention-83" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s confession.</p>

	<p>Assistant State Attorney <span id="mention-84" about="BeverlyAndrews" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Beverly Andrews" data-sort="AndrewsBeverly">Beverly Andrews</span> called <span id="mention-85" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> to the stand before resting her case on a Friday afternoon, ensuring that <span id="mention-86" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s words would be left to linger in jurors’ minds over the weekend. <span id="mention-87" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> — the only person to have offered an account of the murder — had by then refused to testify against <span id="mention-88" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>, leaving a gaping hole at the center of the state’s case. <span id="mention-89" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>, who was facing 20 years in prison on charges of grand theft, stepped into the void. Dark-haired and stocky, with olive skin that offset his gray-blue eyes, <span id="mention-90" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> had a wide, expressive face that was malleable like an actor’s, registering emotions with almost vaudevillian embellishment. His words had a stagy yet captivating sincerity.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-91" about="BeverlyAndrews" class="mention person">Andrews</span> began by leading him through a series of questions that were designed to establish his trustworthiness. No, he had not been promised anything in return for his testimony, he assured the jury solemnly. And yes, he conceded, he had been convicted of some felonies — “five or six, if I am not mistaken” — but he was quick to tell the jury that he had not only assisted the state numerous times as a jailhouse informant; he had also once been a police officer. “I still do have law enforcement inside of me,” he said.</p>

	<p>The story he told the jury was simple but arresting. He was passing by <span id="mention-92" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s cell early one morning, he explained, when <span id="mention-93" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> sought his counsel. <span id="mention-94" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> was under the impression that <span id="mention-95" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> had worked as a private investigator, <span id="mention-96" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> said, and wanted his legal advice.</p>

	<p>It was then, <span id="mention-97" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> testified, as they stood at the bars of <span id="mention-98" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s cell, that <span id="mention-99" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> came clean, confiding that he had stabbed the girl and then thrown the knife away. What <span id="mention-100" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> said “was so hard to comprehend and to accept,” he told the jury earnestly. “I had seen this gentleman walking in the hallways, laughing and kidding with other inmates. And all of a sudden, to see a man’s eyes, and to describe how he can stab a young girl — and she was screaming and staring at him and would not die. ...”</p>

	<p>“Were those Mr. <span id="mention-101" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s words as best you can remember?” <span id="mention-102" about="BeverlyAndrews" class="mention person">Andrews</span> asked.</p>

	<p>“As best I can recall,” <span id="mention-103" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> said gravely. “ ‘She is screaming, staring at me, and would not die.’ ”</p>

	<p>It didn’t matter that <span id="mention-104" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> had few other details about the murder. Any questions as to his truthfulness were put to rest when <span id="mention-105" about="BeverlyAndrews" class="mention person">Andrews</span> called <span id="mention-106" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span> as her final witness. The detective vouched for <span id="mention-107" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>, testifying that the inmate had supplied him with reliable information in other cases, yielding “extremely positive results.”</p>

	<p><span id="mention-108" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> would not testify on the advice of his attorneys, but <span id="mention-109" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> offered a vivid, first-person account of a confession. In a trial that had been long on conjecture but short on hard evidence, his testimony became the linchpin of the state’s case — so much so that <span id="mention-110" about="BeverlyAndrews" class="mention person">Andrews</span> would cite him more than a dozen times in her closing argument. She assured the jury that <span id="mention-111" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was “honest” and “reliable.”</p>

	<p>It was with that imprimatur of credibility that jurors found <span id="mention-112" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> guilty. They also recommended, by a rare unanimous vote, that he be executed. Judge <span id="mention-113" about="ThomasPenickJr" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Thomas Penick Jr." data-sort="PenickThomasJr">Thomas Penick Jr.</span> of the Circuit Court formally sentenced <span id="mention-114" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> to death on <time datetime="1987-08-07">Aug. 7, 1987</time>.</p>

	<p>Five days later, <span id="mention-115" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was released from jail. A <span id="mention-546" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> Parole and Probation Commission memo stated that his release was “due to his cooperation with the State Attorney’s Office in the first-degree murder trial.” It was a remarkable turn of events given that he had been identified as a flight risk just a year earlier, after violating the terms of his parole. “This man has been, is and always will be a danger to society,” his parole officer had warned. Now he was released on his own recognizance and did not have to post bond. <span id="mention-116" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was a free man.</p>

	<p>By then, <span id="mention-117" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> had been in and out of jail half a dozen times. One of his earliest brushes with the law came nearly a decade earlier, in <span id="mention-578" about="Texas" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Texas" data-wikidata-id="Q1439">Texas</span>, through an unusual series of events that began with a misbegotten Christmas present for his third wife, <span id="mention-118" about="RozelleRogers" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Rozelle Rogers">Rozelle Rogers</span>. Their whirlwind romance started in <time datetime="1977">1977</time>, when <span id="mention-119" about="RozelleRogers" class="mention person">Rogers</span>, a divorced mother of two, was leading a quiet life near her well-to-do parents in Friendswood, south of <span id="mention-598" about="Houston" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Houston" data-wikidata-id="Q16555">Houston</span>. “He just came in out of nowhere and swept her off her feet,” said <span id="mention-120" about="RozelleRogers" class="mention person">Rogers</span>’s daughter, <span id="mention-121" about="RozelleRogers" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" data-sort="RogersLisa">Lisa Rogers</span>.</p>

	<p>At 28, <span id="mention-125" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> already had two brief marriages behind him, but <span id="mention-126" about="RozelleRogers" class="mention person">Rogers</span>, who knew little about his past, saw the promise of a new future in the magnetic, seemingly worldly man who lavished her with rapturous flattery and told her he was a top executive at Southwest Airlines. He was less conventional than someone in the corporate world — he wore a gold necklace and a diamond-studded watch with his three-piece suit — but he seemed like a catch.</p>

	<p>After getting married in <span id="mention-577" about="LasVegas" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Las Vegas" data-wikidata-id="Q23768">Las Vegas</span>, <span id="mention-127" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> moved into <span id="mention-128" about="RozelleRogers" class="mention person">Rogers</span>’s condo, where he soon established a routine. On weekday mornings, he bounded out the door, briefcase in hand, telling <span id="mention-129" about="RozelleRogers" class="mention person">Rogers</span> he was headed to the airport to fly to <span id="mention-614" about="Dallas" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Dallas" data-wikidata-id="Q16557">Dallas</span>, where Southwest is headquartered, and assuring her that he would be back home in time for dinner. He always carried a business-size checkbook with him, with which he was profligate, treating her to jewelry, stays at posh big-city hotels and box seats at <span id="mention-590" about="UniversityofTexas" class="mention organization" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:organization" data-label="University of Texas" data-wikidata-id="Q2140391">University of Texas</span> football games, where he boasted of once having been a running back for the team. He tried to outdo himself with each ostentatious flourish, giving <span id="mention-130" about="RozelleRogers" class="mention person">Rogers</span> not just one but two brand-new vehicles: a baby blue Lincoln Continental and a customized Dodge van with red velvet curtains and CB radios. Once he presented Lisa, then 14, with a gold-nugget Seiko watch that sparkled with diamonds. When the eighth grader asked him, point blank, if it was real, <span id="mention-131" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> grinned and replied, “Looks real to me.”</p>

	<p>Lisa had taken note of <span id="mention-132" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s idiosyncrasies: how he filched the robes and towels from their luxury hotel rooms and squirreled away the purple velvet bags that his Crown Royal came in after he had drained the bottles. It didn’t escape her attention, either, that he always kept his handgun within reach, even stashing it under the driver’s seat when he was behind the wheel. In the months that followed, <span id="mention-133" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s behavior became more unpredictable, and he began heading out of town “on business,” he said. Eventually, his absences stretched into weeks and then months, until he disappeared altogether.</p>

	<p>Unknown to <span id="mention-134" about="RozelleRogers" class="mention person">Rogers</span> — who would ultimately have to post notices in the newspaper announcing her intent to divorce him — <span id="mention-135" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> had, by the spring of <time datetime="1978">1978</time>, landed in the <span id="mention-596" about="Houston" class="mention place">Harris County Jail</span>, in <span id="mention-599" about="Houston" class="mention place">Houston</span>, for passing a dozen bad checks, one of which he had used to buy <span id="mention-136" about="RozelleRogers" class="mention person">Rogers</span> a microwave for Christmas. Everything <span id="mention-137" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> had told her was a lie. He had financed their new vehicles, and nearly everything else, on the strength of her good credit, taking out loans he never paid back, opening credit cards in her name and draining her checking account. <span id="mention-138" about="RozelleRogers" class="mention person">Rogers</span>, who died in <time datetime="2005">2005</time>, was left reeling. “He wrecked my mom’s credit, and he wrecked her life,” <span id="mention-139" about="RozelleRogers" class="mention person">Lisa</span> said.</p>

	<p>His arrest was the first time he found himself in serious trouble, though he had been grifting since at least the early 1970s, when he worked as a police officer. He had lasted just 14 months with the Austin Police Department, stepping down in <time datetime="1973">1973</time> after he wrote a string of bad checks. After apologizing for any embarrassment he had brought upon the department, he was never charged. He got off easy again when he was arrested for grand larceny in <span id="mention-669" about="OrangeCounty" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Orange County" data-wikidata-id="Q5925">Orange County</span>, Fla., three years later, after he posed as a furniture salesman and pocketed $700 from an unwitting customer. Even though the police found evidence in his car that suggested he was running another scam — he had a stash of checks, IDs and stationery bearing the seal of the <span id="mention-593" about="TexasStateHouseofRepresentatives" class="mention organization" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:organization" data-label="Texas State House of Representatives">Texas State House of Representatives</span> — he received probation. Only his arrest in <span id="mention-600" about="Houston" class="mention place">Houston</span> in the spring of <time datetime="1978">1978</time>, which violated the terms of his <span id="mention-547" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> probation, brought his lucky streak to an end. Suddenly he was behind bars and looking at jail time in another state.</p>

	<p>It was here, at the <span id="mention-597" about="Houston" class="mention place">Harris County Jail</span>, that <span id="mention-140" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s career as an informant began. As he sat contemplating his future, <span id="mention-141" about="ThomasHirschi" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Thomas Hirschi" data-sort="HirschiThomas">Thomas Hirschi</span>, a defendant in a case that was all over the news, was booked into the jail and placed in a nearby cell. <span id="mention-142" about="ThomasHirschi" class="mention person">Hirschi</span> was one of the “<span id="mention-605" about="MoodyParkThree" class="mention organization" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:organization" data-label="Moody Park Three">Moody Park Three</span>,” a trio of anti-police-brutality activists whom the D.A.’s office had charged with inciting a riot at Moody Park, in <span id="mention-601" about="Houston" class="mention place">Houston</span>, that left 15 people hospitalized. The uprising came a year after the death of a 23-year-old laborer named <span id="mention-143" about="JosCamposTorres" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="José Campos Torres" data-sort="TorresJoséCampos">José Campos Torres</span> at the hands of <span id="mention-602" about="Houston" class="mention place">Houston</span> police officers. The officers who beat <span id="mention-144" about="JosCamposTorres" class="mention person">Torres</span> and pushed him into a bayou to drown — “Let’s see if the wetback can swim,” one famously taunted — received only slaps on the wrist. City leaders blamed “outside agitators” like <span id="mention-145" about="ThomasHirschi" class="mention person">Hirschi</span>, who had called for <span id="mention-146" about="JosCamposTorres" class="mention person">Torres</span>’s killers to be brought to justice, for the riot rather than acknowledging that years of police brutality pushed the Mexican-American community to its breaking point. To the <span id="mention-606" about="MoodyParkThree" class="mention organization">Moody Park Three</span>’s supporters, it was a frame-up. To prosecutors, it was a case they needed to win.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-147" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> would later place a call to the D.A.’s office, claiming to have information on the case. Prosecutors put him on the stand when <span id="mention-148" about="ThomasHirschi" class="mention person">Hirschi</span> and his co-defendants, <span id="mention-149" about="TravisMorales" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Travis Morales" data-sort="MoralesTravis">Travis Morales</span> and <span id="mention-150" about="MaraYoungdahl" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Mara Youngdahl" data-sort="YoungdahlMara">Mara Youngdahl</span>, were tried together in <time datetime="1979-05">May 1979</time>.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-151" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s first time testifying as a jailhouse informant was less sure-footed than his later turns as a witness for the state, but he hewed closely to a story line that he would use again and again in the years to come. He told the jury that he was standing outside <span id="mention-152" about="ThomasHirschi" class="mention person">Hirschi</span>’s cell when the young activist decided to unburden himself and confess that <span id="mention-153" about="TravisMorales" class="mention person">Morales</span>’s plan all along had been “to incite the Mexican-American youngsters,” <span id="mention-154" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> said. As <span id="mention-155" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> spoke, <span id="mention-156" about="ThomasHirschi" class="mention person">Hirschi</span> sat at the defense table in disbelief. “I’d never seen the guy before,” <span id="mention-157" about="ThomasHirschi" class="mention person">Hirschi</span> told me. “Never seen his face, didn’t know his name.”</p>

	<p><span id="mention-158" about="ThomasHirschi" class="mention person">Hirschi</span> and his co-defendants were looking at up to 20 years in prison if convicted. “We weren’t naïve, but to actually see this unfold in front of us — to watch him lie when our lives were on the line — was pretty shocking,” <span id="mention-159" about="ThomasHirschi" class="mention person">Hirschi</span> said.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-160" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s strategy paid off. Prosecutors prevailed in the end; the <span id="mention-607" about="MoodyParkThree" class="mention organization">Moody Park Three</span> were found guilty, though the jury declined to give them any prison time. After <span id="mention-161" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> spent two months in jail in <span id="mention-603" about="Houston" class="mention place">Houston</span>, he was sentenced that November to a year in the <span id="mention-670" about="OrangeCounty" class="mention place">Orange County</span> Jail, in <span id="mention-548" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span>, for violating his probation. But four days before Christmas, a <span id="mention-549" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> Circuit Court judge abruptly reversed course, stating that he had “received a recommendation” that <span id="mention-162" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> be moved from the jail to a work-release program — a privilege normally forbidden to repeat offenders. The judge did not specify whether <span id="mention-581" about="Texas" class="mention place">Texas</span> prosecutors were behind that recommendation. But the lesson was unmistakable: The best way for a man behind bars to help himself was to help prosecutors.</p>

	<p>Just two months later, in <time datetime="1980-02">February 1980</time>, <span id="mention-163" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was not only out of jail but also married to a woman who believed that her clean-cut, churchgoing husband was a law student. It was this marriage — his fourth — that brought him to <span id="mention-164" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span>. While living with her in <span id="mention-611" about="StPetersburg" class="mention place">St. Petersburg</span>, he got engaged to another woman in nearby <span id="mention-612" about="Largo" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Largo" data-wikidata-id="Q932577">Largo</span>, telling her he was a <span id="mention-615" about="Dallas" class="mention place">Dallas</span> attorney who wanted to move his law practice to <span id="mention-550" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span>. He persuaded her to take out $3,500 in loans to help him set up his new law office — money he promised to pay back but never did. His wife learned of his engagement only when he was arrested for grand theft. <span id="mention-165" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>, who faced up to five years in prison, was left in the <span id="mention-166" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span> Jail to await his trial.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-167" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> had another plan. As he had done in <span id="mention-604" about="Houston" class="mention place">Houston</span>, he placed a call to prosecutors. So began a yearslong working relationship between <span id="mention-168" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> and the state attorney’s office in <span id="mention-169" about="Clearwater" class="mention place">Clearwater</span>, which would extend through much of the 1980s and involve at least 11 local prosecutors. “The state attorney’s office has always characterized me as an honest, forthright witness,” he later wrote to a judge, “and together, we never lost a case.”</p>

	<p>Ten days before his grand-theft case went to trial in <time datetime="1981-08">August 1981</time>, <span id="mention-170" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> provided the state attorney’s office with information on three different defendants who were charged with murder but whose cases had not yet gone to trial. In return, prosecutors offered him a deal. If he pleaded guilty, they would recommend that he spend no more than three years in prison — two fewer than he was facing. They also left open the possibility that he could secure a sweeter deal if he cooperated further. (“Probation was discussed!” states a handwritten note in the state attorney’s files.) <span id="mention-171" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> took the plea, and his sentencing was postponed while he quietly went to work as a jailhouse informant. Prosecutors would hold off on making a sentencing recommendation until they saw exactly how much <span id="mention-172" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> had to offer and how helpful he could be to them. In the meantime, he would remain in jail, a snitch.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-173" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> made himself busy that fall and winter, and into the following June, testifying for the state in two drug-trafficking trials and providing a damaging deposition in a high-profile murder case. In each case, <span id="mention-174" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> could truthfully say under oath that he had not been promised anything in return for his testimony because no specific agreements had yet been struck. The narratives he told were strikingly similar, featuring inmates who not only freely admitted their guilt but also did so spontaneously in the same oddly stilted language. In a drug-trafficking case that ended in a guilty verdict, <span id="mention-175" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> testified that the defendant had struck up a conversation with him — midway through the accused’s trial, no less — that began with the declaration, “We were loading the boat with 24,000 pounds of marijuana in <span id="mention-617" about="Colombia" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Colombia" data-wikidata-id="Q739">Colombia</span>.”</p>

	<p><span id="mention-176" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was rewarded on <time datetime="1982-06-30">June 30, 1982</time>, when, with the backing of the state attorney’s office, he was sentenced to probation. For someone who had racked up five criminal charges in nearly as many years and left the state the last time he was on probation, it was an astonishing feat.</p>

	<p>Buried deep in thousands of pages of court records spread across two states lies evidence to suggest that <span id="mention-177" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was one of the most prolific, and most effective, jailhouse informants in American history. “I have placed 34 individuals in prison, including four on death row,” he boasted in a <time datetime="1984">1984</time> letter to Senator <span id="mention-178" about="LawtonChiles" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Lawton Chiles" data-sort="ChilesLawton" data-wikidata-id="Q744098">Lawton Chiles</span> of <span id="mention-551" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span>, in a request for favorable treatment — a number that, while inflated at the time, would ultimately prove accurate. During a single six-year span, from 1981 to 1987, <span id="mention-179" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> testified or supplied information in at least 37 cases in <span id="mention-180" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span> alone. Many were cases in which people faced the most serious possible charges and the most severe penalties. Eighteen defendants whose cases <span id="mention-181" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> provided information on were under indictment for murder. A vast majority of their cases ended in convictions or plea deals. Four were sentenced to death.</p>

	<p>The state attorney’s office in <span id="mention-182" about="Clearwater" class="mention place">Clearwater</span>, in an emailed statement, said <span id="mention-183" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> independently got fellow inmates to confide in him, then contacted prosecutors or the <span id="mention-184" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span> sheriff’s office. “He at no time was an ‘agent’ of the sheriff’s office or the state attorney’s office,” it said. “The state attorney’s office never provided any leniency to <span id="mention-185" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Paul Skalnik</span> in exchange for his testimony.” All information provided by <span id="mention-186" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>, the statement said, was independently verified, and the office has never received any information to indicate that his testimony was “incorrect.”</p>

	<p>Still, <span id="mention-187" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s journey through the criminal-justice system affords a rare opportunity to see exactly how prosecutors and jailhouse informants work together. These insights are possible because of a rare confluence of forces, including <span id="mention-188" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s extensive history of informing and <span id="mention-552" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span>’s strong public-record laws, which enabled <span id="mention-189" about="ProPublica" class="mention organization">ProPublica</span> and <span id="mention-190" about="TheNewYorkTimesMagazine" class="mention organization">The New York Times Magazine</span> to obtain thousands of pages of police reports, arrest records, jail logs, probation and parole records, pretrial interviews and correspondence that document his activity in sometimes granular detail. This reporting follows decades of litigation waged by public defenders and pro bono attorneys representing death-row inmates in whose cases <span id="mention-191" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> played a role. The full record provides a vivid picture of how jailhouse informants are used, showing which benefits <span id="mention-192" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was afforded, which crimes he eluded punishment for and, most clearly, how the state attorney’s office put this witness, who was dubbed “a con man extraordinaire,” in the words of one warrant for his arrest, on the stand in cases where defendants’ lives hung in the balance.</p>

	<p>In response to detailed questions about the <span id="mention-193" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> trial, <span id="mention-194" about="BeverlyAndrews" class="mention person">Beverly Andrews</span> (now <span id="mention-195" about="BeverlyAndrews" class="mention person">Beverly Andringa</span>), who prosecuted the case, said in an email that she has “very little memory” of the more-than-30-year-old case, but she said that she “never willfully and intentionally provided false evidence or testimony to a court or jury on any case.” <span id="mention-196" about="RobertHeyman" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Robert Heyman" data-sort="HeymanRobert">Robert Heyman</span>, a prosecutor who tried the case with her, pointed out that <span id="mention-197" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> had been vetted by law enforcement and called to testify by other prosecutors. “If we did not believe that his testimony was truthful, we wouldn’t have had him testify,” <span id="mention-198" about="RobertHeyman" class="mention person">Heyman</span> said.</p>

	<p>Yet again and again, prosecutors have shown that they are willing to rely on the testimony of witnesses like <span id="mention-199" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>, even in cases in which the death penalty is in play. “Jailhouse informants are common in prosecutions of very serious crimes, including ones that carry life and even death sentences,” said <span id="mention-200" about="MichelleFeldman" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Michelle Feldman" data-sort="FeldmanMichelle">Michelle Feldman</span>, the Innocence Project’s state campaigns director, whose work focuses on legislative efforts to regulate the use of jailhouse informants. “Since the courts don’t track them, it’s hard to say which jurisdictions use them the most or how often they testify. But they remain an entrenched feature of criminal prosecutions, even though they are the most unreliable kind of witnesses.”</p>

	<p>What makes them so unreliable, she emphasized, is the widespread understanding in jail that prosecutors can offer substantial benefits in exchange for cooperation — rewards that may include not just reduced sentences or improved jail conditions but cash payments. “There is a very strong incentive to lie and very little disincentive not to,” <span id="mention-201" about="MichelleFeldman" class="mention person">Feldman</span> said.</p>

	<p>The consequences of snitch testimony can be catastrophic. Of the 367 DNA exonerations in the United States to date, jailhouse informants played a role in nearly one in five of the underlying wrongful convictions. A seminal <time datetime="2004">2004</time> study conducted by <span id="mention-618" about="NorthwesternLawSchoolsCenteronWrongfulConvictions" class="mention organization" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:organization" data-label="Northwestern Law School’s Center on Wrongful Convictions">Northwestern Law School’s Center on Wrongful Convictions</span> found that testimony from jailhouse snitches and other criminal informants was the leading cause of wrongful convictions in capital cases. Today nearly a quarter of death-row exonerations — 22 percent — stem from cases in which prosecutors relied on a jailhouse informant.</p>

	<p>Informants often end up on the stand when other evidence is weak; a case that is based on rigorous forensic work or witness testimony that can be independently corroborated does not need a snitch to paper over the gaps. The most unreliable witnesses, then, may testify in the least sound cases — and in cases in which the stakes are the highest.</p>

	<p>Given how opaque and unchecked prosecutors’ use of jailhouse informants is, it is impossible to quantify how often they factor into criminal cases. Usually the only glimpse of the government’s reliance on them comes when a scandal erupts, as it did in <span id="mention-619" about="LosAngeles" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Los Angeles" data-wikidata-id="Q65">Los Angeles</span> in the late 1980s, after a serial snitch named <span id="mention-202" about="LeslieVernonWhite" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Leslie Vernon White" data-sort="VernonWhiteLeslie">Leslie Vernon White</span> went public. In an interview for “<span id="mention-674" about="entity60Minutes" class="mention organization" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:organization" data-label="60 Minutes" data-wikidata-id="Q247869">60 Minutes</span>,” he demonstrated how easy it was to manufacture a confession, procuring key details of a murder on camera in the course of just a few phone calls. His claims led to a grand-jury investigation into jailhouse informants that was the first of its kind. The inquiry exposed extensive prosecutorial misconduct and the widespread misuse of jailhouse informants, who had concocted persuasive-sounding confessions in a variety of ingenious ways. Some impersonated law-enforcement officers to make calls eliciting information; others sent friends and relatives to court hearings to suss out other defendants’ cases. Many were fed information by law enforcement, who shared arrest reports, photos and case files with inmates, even escorting them to crime scenes so they could better shape their testimony to fit the evidence. The grand jury identified upward of 150 cases, and perhaps as many as 250, that were affected.</p>

	<p>In the wake of the scandal, the <span id="mention-624" about="LosAngeles" class="mention place">Los Angeles County</span> district attorney’s office instituted reforms to provide more oversight of prosecutors who put jailhouse informants on the stand, but beyond <span id="mention-621" about="LosAngeles" class="mention place">Los Angeles</span>, little changed. <span id="mention-625" about="TheChicagoTribune" class="mention organization" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:organization" data-label="The Chicago Tribune" data-wikidata-id="Q47596">The Chicago Tribune</span> raised the alarm in <time datetime="1999">1999</time>, when it highlighted prosecutors’ overreliance on jailhouse informants in death-penalty cases in <span id="mention-626" about="Illinois" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Illinois" data-wikidata-id="Q1204">Illinois</span>, and found that such testimony had helped convict or condemn four of the state’s 12 death-row exonerees. In the aftermath of the report, which identified numerous problems with the death penalty in <span id="mention-627" about="Illinois" class="mention place">Illinois</span>, Gov. <span id="mention-203" about="GeorgeRyan" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="George Ryan" data-sort="RyanGeorge" data-wikidata-id="Q887327">George Ryan</span> declared a statewide moratorium on executions, but nationally, the harms of jailhouse informants went unaddressed.</p>

	<p>In the 1990s and 2000s, the accrual of DNA exonerations — made possible by the advent of a then-new and revelatory technology — laid bare the fact that snitch testimony had contributed to wrongful convictions across the country. Nevertheless, the authors of the <time datetime="2004">2004</time> Northwestern Law study were fatalistic, writing, “The reality is that neither legislatures nor courts are about to ban snitch testimony in the prevailing tough-on-crime political climate.”</p>

	<p>In <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, a quarter-century after the <span id="mention-622" about="LosAngeles" class="mention place">Los Angeles</span> snitch scandal began, another scandal broke in neighboring <span id="mention-671" about="OrangeCounty" class="mention place">Orange County</span>. A local public defender was able to show that for years, sheriff’s deputies had engaged in a practice of strategically planting informants in the cells of defendants who were awaiting trial. Inmates who produced incriminating information — including “confessions” they elicited with threats of violence — were rewarded with money and sentence reductions.</p>

	<p>Orange County’s top prosecutors and law-​enforcement officials were implicated, and according to a pending <span id="mention-634" about="ACLU" class="mention organization" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:organization" data-label="A.C.L.U." data-wikidata-id="Q21637">A.C.L.U.</span> lawsuit against the county’s district attorney’s office and Sheriff’s Department, at least 140 cases were tainted. Though no law-enforcement officials were fired or disciplined, the scandal contributed to voters’ ouster of <span id="mention-672" about="OrangeCounty" class="mention place">Orange County</span>’s longtime district attorney, <span id="mention-204" about="TonyRackauckas" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Tony Rackauckas" data-sort="RackauckasTony">Tony Rackauckas</span>, and convictions in dozens of cases were subsequently challenged.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-205" about="AlexandraNatapoff" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Alexandra Natapoff" data-sort="NatapoffAlexandra">Alexandra Natapoff</span>, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who is the nation’s foremost legal scholar on criminal informants, said the parallels between the two California scandals show how little has changed in 30 years and how little we know about how often jailhouse informants continue to be used across the country. “In <span id="mention-673" about="OrangeCounty" class="mention place">Orange County</span>, a sophisticated jailhouse-informant system remained under the radar, not disclosed in court cases for decades,” <span id="mention-206" about="AlexandraNatapoff" class="mention person">Natapoff</span> said. “The accident is that we know about it, not that it happened.”</p>

	<p>The benefits jailhouse informants receive, she added, are rarely apparent to jurors, because prosecutors often bestow them on the back end, after a trial’s conclusion. “Many jailhouse informants can truthfully state to the jury that they have not been promised any benefit, even though realistically they expect to be compensated for their testimony,” <span id="mention-207" about="AlexandraNatapoff" class="mention person">Natapoff</span> said. “Ironically, jurors will often be the only people in the courtroom who do not understand this arrangement.”</p>

	<p><span id="mention-208" about="KarenParker" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Karen Parker" data-sort="ParkerKaren">Karen Parker</span> was 12 when she crossed paths with <span id="mention-209" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>. “He appeared out of nowhere,” she told me. “He befriended my mom and dad, and suddenly he was in our life.” It was <time datetime="1982-07">July 1982</time>, the middle of a long and restive summer, and <span id="mention-210" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span> usually passed the time at the beach or riding her bike around her working-class neighborhood in Seminole, south of <span id="mention-211" about="Clearwater" class="mention place">Clearwater</span>. <span id="mention-212" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> — who had found work with her next-door neighbor’s brother, a private investigator — was often around, holding her father rapt with stories of his days as a police officer. He struck <span id="mention-213" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span> as impossibly cool, a sharp dresser with a certain louche charm. “He was magnetic, out of the ordinary — not like other people I knew,” she said. “And he was very attentive to me. He’d give me that extra look, and I had the sense that he was interested. I was drawn in.” She was thirsty for male approval; at home, where her father was stern and critical, she received none. To <span id="mention-214" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span>, <span id="mention-215" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s attention was exhilarating.</p>

	<p>One day that July, she went fishing with her next-door neighbors in <span id="mention-613" about="Largo" class="mention place">Largo</span>, and <span id="mention-216" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> joined them for the outing. It was dark when they returned to Seminole, and he summoned her to come sit beside him in the front seat of his silver <span id="mention-642" about="Cadillac" class="mention thing" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:thing" data-label="Cadillac" data-wikidata-id="Q27436">Cadillac</span>. By then, her neighbors had gone inside. Suddenly he was kissing <span id="mention-217" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span>, his hands slipping under her T-shirt. Then his fingers were inside her. “He took my hand and put it on his penis,” she said. “He had me masturbate him until he ejaculated.” <span id="mention-218" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span> had just finished the seventh grade. <span id="mention-219" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was 32.</p>

	<p>His voice turned cold afterward, she said, when he advised her, obliquely, to keep quiet. “One of these days you’re going to open your mouth too many times,” he said, suggesting that doing so could land her in “J.D.C.” — juvenile detention. “The only one who is going to be in trouble is you.”</p>

	<p><span id="mention-220" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span> spoke to only one person about what had happened, a 16-year-old girl who lived next door and glimpsed <span id="mention-221" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> kissing her in the car. But the story eventually leaked out later that year, after <span id="mention-222" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was arrested for grand theft. Upon learning of the assault, <span id="mention-223" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span>’s parents took her to the sheriff’s office. <span id="mention-224" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was charged in <time datetime="1982-12">December 1982</time> with “lewd and lascivious conduct on a child under 14,” a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison.</p>

	<p>The case against him was a strong one. <span id="mention-225" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span>’s description of the assault was bolstered by the eyewitness account from the 16-year-old neighbor she confided in and another from the 16-year-old’s boyfriend, who, as he approached the car, saw “movement in the suspect’s lap (suspect’s hand or victim’s) of a masturbatory nature,” according to the police report. And unlike some victims of child sexual abuse, <span id="mention-226" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span> was old enough to clearly articulate what happened to her and was willing to testify. “I don’t think it is right that he is calling me a liar and I am not,” she told investigators. There were also the results of a polygraph examination that the sheriff’s office administered to <span id="mention-227" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span>. (“Have you ever heard of a 12-year-old girl having to take a polygraph?” she asked me, still incredulous.) Polygraphs have since been shown to be unreliable and are not generally admissible in court, but they were central to many law-enforcement agencies’ investigations in the 1980s; the fact that <span id="mention-228" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span> passed, and that her account of the assault was found to be truthful, was meaningful at the time. All told, prosecutors had a case they could take to trial. Child sexual-assault cases are routinely prosecuted on far less.</p>

	<p>But the state attorney’s office would ultimately decline to try <span id="mention-229" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>. In a plea hearing that took place on <time datetime="1983-03-10">March 10, 1983</time>, prosecutors agreed to dismiss the molestation charge. In return, <span id="mention-230" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> pleaded no contest to new charges of grand theft, for which he had been arrested the previous November. (True to form, <span id="mention-231" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> had tricked a woman into giving him nearly $5,000 on the promise of starting a travel agency together, and defrauded a couple out of more than $20,000 by assuring them that he could deliver discounted cars that were forfeited to the state in narcotics cases — all of which violated his probation in the previous grand-theft case involving his fiancée.) These charges carried much lighter punishments than child molestation. The state attorney’s notice to the court dismissing the lewd-and-lascivious conduct charge said simply, “There is insufficient evidence available at this time.”</p>

	<p><span id="mention-232" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> took the plea deal, for which he received concurrent five-year sentences. But instead of being sent to state prison to serve out his punishment, he would remain in the <span id="mention-233" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span> Jail, where he could continue to work as a jailhouse informant, gathering information on defendants who had not yet gone to trial. (Prosecutors argued that keeping him in the county jail was for his safety, given that his testimony had helped send men to prison.) And with the child-molestation charge out of the way, <span id="mention-234" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> came across to jurors as a far more innocuous figure than he actually was — that is, as a former police officer turned small-time scam artist, rather than as a child molester.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-235" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span> belongs to a group of crime victims who remain forgotten in a criminal-justice system that allows jailhouse informants to be released, and to continue committing crimes, because prosecutors exchanged leniency for their testimony. <span id="mention-236" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span> never knew about prosecutors’ deal with <span id="mention-237" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>, only that he was never punished for what he did to her. “No one ever said, ‘That’s wrong,’ ” she told me. “The message I got was that what he did was O.K. — that it wasn’t serious, it wasn’t a crime.” In her father’s eyes, she said, it was she who was to blame for what happened. “Everyone liked Paul, and they believed Paul, and I was seen as the troublemaker,” she said. After <span id="mention-238" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s arrest, her father’s harsh criticism of her escalated, until it became unbearable. <span id="mention-239" about="KarenParker" class="mention person">Parker</span> ran away the following year, when she was 13, and left home for good when she was 14, taking refuge at a runaway shelter. “I didn’t trust anyone for a long, long time,” she said.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-245" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>, meanwhile, continued to be valuable to the state attorney’s office after his molestation charge was dismissed in <time datetime="1983">1983</time>. That year and the next, he testified in four high-profile murder trials, three of which ended with death sentences. All three of the men who were condemned to die — <span id="mention-246" about="RichardCooper" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Richard Cooper" data-sort="CooperRichard">Richard Cooper</span>, <span id="mention-247" about="Gardner" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Kenneth Gardner" data-sort="GardnerKenneth">Kenneth Gardner</span> and <span id="mention-248" about="JDWalton" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="J.D. Walton" data-sort="WaltonJ.D.">J.D. Walton</span> — had, without question, been present at the scenes of the horrendous crimes they stood accused of. But because several people were charged in connection to each murder, the key question at <span id="mention-249" about="RichardCooper" class="mention person">Cooper</span>’s, <span id="mention-250" about="Gardner" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Kenneth Gardner" data-sort="GardnerKenneth">Gardner</span>’s and <span id="mention-251" about="JDWalton" class="mention person">Walton</span>’s trials was one of culpability: How much of a role did the accused play, and were his actions egregious enough to warrant the electric chair? Prosecutors used <span id="mention-252" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> to show that each man was not just guilty but also deserved death.</p>

	<p>At the time, in the 1980s, appearing soft on crime was a surefire way to be voted out of office. “In <span id="mention-554" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span>, prosecutors, judges, the attorney general, the governor — everyone wanted to prove how tough they were,” <span id="mention-253" about="Bright" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Stephen Bright" data-sort="BrightStephen">Stephen Bright</span> told me. <span id="mention-254" about="Bright" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Stephen Bright" data-sort="BrightStephen">Bright</span>, one of the nation’s pre-eminent capital defense attorneys and a visiting lecturer at <span id="mention-643" about="YaleLawSchool" class="mention organization" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:organization" data-label="Yale Law School" data-wikidata-id="Q1143289">Yale Law School</span>, went to <span id="mention-255" about="Clearwater" class="mention place">Clearwater</span> in <time datetime="1985">1985</time> to challenge the conviction and death sentence of a man who was bound for the electric chair. Gov. <span id="mention-256" about="BobGraham" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Bob Graham" data-sort="GrahamBob" data-wikidata-id="Q578102">Bob Graham</span> of <span id="mention-555" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span>, who earned the nickname <span id="mention-647" about="BobGraham" class="mention person">Governor Jell-O</span> because he was seen as weak and ineffective, reinvented himself by signing death warrants, increasing the number of warrants he signed when he ran for re-election in <time datetime="1982">1982</time>, and again when he ran for Senate in <time datetime="1986">1986</time>. “In <span id="mention-556" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span>,” <span id="mention-257" about="Bright" class="mention person">Bright</span> added, “it seemed like there couldn’t be enough death sentences.”</p>

	<p>Even so, <span id="mention-258" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span> stood out. For a three-year period, from 1982 to 1984, it sent more people to death row than any other county in <span id="mention-557" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span>. At the time, the state attorney’s office was run by a hard-charging prosecutor named <span id="mention-259" about="JamesTRussell" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="James T. Russell" data-sort="RussellJamesT.">James T. Russell</span>, who stood just 5-foot-5 but enjoyed a fearsome reputation. A perfectionist whose moral universe had no shades of gray, <span id="mention-260" about="JamesTRussell" class="mention person">Russell</span> pursued a law-and-order agenda that appealed to his constituents, who were disproportionately older and overwhelmingly white. “Put more criminals in prison, and there will be less crime on the streets,” he told a local civic group in <time datetime="1981">1981</time>, condemning what he perceived to be a system that placed too much emphasis on rehabilitating people who broke the law. (<span id="mention-261" about="JamesTRussell" class="mention person">Russell</span> died in <time datetime="2006">2006</time>.) Few questioned the bare-knuckled tactics behind his office’s conviction rate, which reached 92 percent in <time datetime="1990">1990</time>. So fierce was the drive to rack up wins that prosecutors “sought the death penalty in nearly every first-degree murder case,” according to a <time datetime="1988">1988</time> survey by a local public defender — a strategy that allowed them to leverage the threat of the electric chair to extract guilty pleas from defendants.</p>

	<p>The demand for convictions and long, tough sentences made <span id="mention-262" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s testimony invaluable. The confessions he recounted were lurid and dramatic, strewn with provocative details that prosecutors used not just to show the guilt of the defendants but also to establish that they were diabolically evil. <span id="mention-263" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> told of victims’ begging for their lives and of remorseless killers who laughed after their slaughters, boasting that they had outsmarted prosecutors and the police. <span id="mention-264" about="Gardner" class="mention person">Gardner</span>, who was convicted in a grisly stabbing death of a hardware-store owner, supposedly bragged to <span id="mention-265" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>, “I killed him, but they’ll never prove it.” <span id="mention-266" about="JDWalton" class="mention person">Walton</span>, who was found guilty of carrying out the execution of three men after a botched robbery, considered the whole thing “a funny joke,” <span id="mention-267" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> told jurors. And <span id="mention-268" about="RichardCooper" class="mention person">Cooper</span>, one of <span id="mention-269" about="JDWalton" class="mention person">Walton</span>’s co-defendants, supposedly introduced himself to <span id="mention-270" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> with the brash declaration, “I’m one of the men involved in the triple-murder slayings they thought was a Mafia gangland killing.”</p>

	<p>Though <span id="mention-271" about="RichardCooper" class="mention person">Cooper</span> might have earned the jury’s mercy because he was a teenager, <span id="mention-272" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> turned that potentially mitigating fact on its head by sharing an offhand comment he attributed to <span id="mention-273" about="RichardCooper" class="mention person">Cooper</span>. “He said no jury would ever sentence him to the death chair,” <span id="mention-274" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> testified, “because he’s 19 years old and because he’s got that little baby face.” The jury recommended that <span id="mention-275" about="RichardCooper" class="mention person">Cooper</span> be put to death. (<span id="mention-276" about="Gardner" class="mention person">Gardner</span> and <span id="mention-277" about="RichardCooper" class="mention person">Cooper</span> would eventually be resentenced to life in prison.)</p>

	<p>The confessions he claimed these men volunteered to him — and that the state attorney’s office had him repeat to juries — were all the more extraordinary given that he was held in protective custody and that his reputation as a snitch was well known to other men in the jail. “Beginning to encounter more and more inmates who recognize him,” stated a note in his file from <time datetime="1983-01">January 1983</time>. Nevertheless, <span id="mention-278" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was sometimes moved closer to, or even into the same cell as, a defendant in a newsworthy case. <span id="mention-279" about="RichardCooper" class="mention person">Cooper</span> was assigned to a two-man cell with <span id="mention-280" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>; <span id="mention-281" about="Gardner" class="mention person">Gardner</span> was later assigned to a cell that adjoined <span id="mention-282" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s. It was during their brief time in proximity to him that each supposedly came clean. A third inmate, a co-defendant of <span id="mention-283" about="RichardCooper" class="mention person">Cooper</span>’s named <span id="mention-284" about="TerryVanRoyal" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Terry Van Royal" data-sort="VanRoyalTerry">Terry Van Royal</span>, protested when <span id="mention-285" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was moved into his cell. “I told the guard I would not be in the same cell with him,” <span id="mention-286" about="TerryVanRoyal" class="mention person">Van Royal</span> later wrote in an affidavit, “because I knew who he was and what he did.”</p>

	<p>If defense attorneys tried to suggest that <span id="mention-287" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s preternatural ability to extract men’s most closely held secrets was too good to be true, <span id="mention-288" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> would insist that he stood to gain nothing from his testimony, as he did during the <time datetime="1983">1983</time> murder trial of <span id="mention-289" about="FreddieGaines" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Freddie Gaines" data-sort="GainesFreddie">Freddie Gaines</span>. A 24-year-old handyman, <span id="mention-290" about="FreddieGaines" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Freddy Gaines" data-sort="GainesFreddy">Gaines</span> was charged with stabbing his girlfriend’s ex-lover to death in a bar brawl — a chance encounter, <span id="mention-291" about="FreddieGaines" class="mention person">Gaines</span> told the jury, that turned violent. But <span id="mention-292" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s testimony jettisoned any notion that <span id="mention-293" about="FreddieGaines" class="mention person">Gaines</span> acted spontaneously; to hear him tell it, <span id="mention-294" about="FreddieGaines" class="mention person">Gaines</span> had carried out a calculated, coldblooded murder. <span id="mention-295" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> said <span id="mention-296" about="FreddieGaines" class="mention person">Gaines</span> boasted of bringing a knife to the bar and seeking out the victim, telling <span id="mention-297" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> he should have been charged “with open-heart surgery.” <span id="mention-298" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s voice swelled with emotion as he spoke, so much that he once appeared to be on the brink of tears.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-299" about="FreddieGaines" class="mention person">Gaines</span> told me that he was floored when he heard <span id="mention-300" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> testify and that he leaned over and told his lawyer: “He’s sitting right there telling a lie. Me and this man ain’t never talked before.” But <span id="mention-301" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s testimony was effective, recasting a possible crime of passion into a premeditated execution — a distinction that would help earn <span id="mention-302" about="FreddieGaines" class="mention person">Gaines</span> a conviction for first-degree murder and a life sentence, rather than a lesser charge like manslaughter, which carried a penalty of up to 15 years.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-308" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> assured the jury that he had come forward with no other motive than to preserve public safety. “I used to be a police officer,” he said, adding that he became an informant after hearing other men in the jail brag that they were going to beat their charges. Assistant State Attorney <span id="mention-309" about="BruceYoung" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Bruce Young" data-sort="YoungBruce">Bruce Young</span> bolstered the idea that <span id="mention-310" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s intentions were selfless. “It’s your understanding that nothing can be done for you as far as eliminating or reducing your sentence?” <span id="mention-311" about="BruceYoung" class="mention person">Young</span> asked.</p>

	<p>“That’s correct,” <span id="mention-312" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> replied.</p>

Expressing concern for <span id="mention-318" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s safety, he asked that his star witness not be sent to state prison but remain in the jail; better yet, <span id="mention-319" about="BruceYoung" class="mention person">Young</span> proposed, the State of <span id="mention-560" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> could simply release him. “If Mr. <span id="mention-320" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> is eligible for parole,” he wrote, “I would urge that Mr. <span id="mention-321" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> be considered for parole.” (<span id="mention-322" about="BruceYoung" class="mention person">Young</span> did not respond to detailed requests for comment.)</p>

	<p>One of <span id="mention-323" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s most loyal supporters would also go to bat for him. <span id="mention-324" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">John Halliday</span> — the detective who previously worked with <span id="mention-325" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> and would later receive key information from him in the <span id="mention-326" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> case — called the parole board that fall on his behalf. “Mr. <span id="mention-327" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span> would like the commission to know the subject has been of great assistance to the sheriff’s office,” reads an interoffice memo documenting the call. <span id="mention-328" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span> wrote directly to a parole commissioner the next month, urging him to consider <span id="mention-329" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> for release. “I have never done this for an inmate during my 10 years in law enforcement,” <span id="mention-330" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span> added.</p>

	<p>(<span id="mention-331" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span> declined to review a detailed request for comment, referring it to <span id="mention-332" about="KeithJohnson" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Keith Johnson" data-sort="JohnsonKeith">Keith Johnson</span>, an investigator for the state attorney’s office. <span id="mention-333" about="KeithJohnson" class="mention person">Johnson</span> referred the request to the state attorney’s office, which declined to comment about <span id="mention-334" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span>, as did a spokeswoman for the <span id="mention-335" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span> sheriff’s office, who noted that the cases in question took place long ago.)</p>

	<p>On <time datetime="1985-03-19">March 19, 1985</time>, <span id="mention-336" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was paroled. Having served about half of his five-year sentence for grand theft, he was free, despite assessments from the Department of Corrections that judged him to be a “con artist of the highest degree” who was at “high risk of further unlawful behavior.” Sure enough, after <span id="mention-337" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was released, he cheated an elderly woman out of tens of thousands of dollars for two <span id="mention-676" about="LincolnTown" class="mention thing" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:thing" data-label="Lincoln Town" data-wikidata-id="Q516413">Lincoln Town</span> Cars he never delivered; conned another woman out of thousands more with a phony real estate deal; and duped a jewelry-store clerk into taking a check from what turned out to be a defunct bank account for a $6,100 gold Rolex. He also married and divorced his fifth wife.</p>

	<p>By <time datetime="1986-11-24">Nov. 24, 1986</time>, he was back in the <span id="mention-338" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span> Jail, where he would claim, the following summer, to have procured <span id="mention-339" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">James Dailey</span>’s confession. “Mr. <span id="mention-340" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s deceitful nature knows no bounds,” an unknown person wrote in a handwritten letter to the state attorney’s office, urging prosecutors to punish him as harshly as the law would allow. “How many chances will this man be given? How many more people will he hurt and victimize?”</p>

	<p>As reform-minded prosecutors have swept into office over the past five years in cities like Chicago, St. Louis, <span id="mention-616" about="Dallas" class="mention place">Dallas</span>, Philadelphia and Boston, some district attorney’s offices have begun to re-evaluate the way they have always done business. “People in these communities have made very clear that a win-at-all-costs approach is not what they want anymore and does not make them safer,” said <span id="mention-341" about="MiriamKrinsky" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Miriam Krinsky">Miriam Krinsky</span>, a former federal prosecutor and executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution, a network for progressive prosecutors. In an effort to stem mass incarceration, reformers have focused their energy on trying to address the big, structural problems that most directly affect people’s liberty, like changing the cash-bail system and diverting defendants to drug treatment instead of prison.</p>

	<p>So far, the use of jailhouse informants has received relatively little consideration. “It’s an issue that is just starting to gain attention,” <span id="mention-342" about="MiriamKrinsky" class="mention person">Krinsky</span> said. “There is a new dialogue about whether prosecutors should institute safeguards that would allow them to continue using jailhouse informants but proceed with caution, or whether to steer clear of jailhouse informants completely.”</p>

	<p>In some state legislatures, the idea of bringing greater scrutiny to jailhouse informants has slowly begun to gain traction. In <time datetime="2017">2017</time>, <span id="mention-582" about="Texas" class="mention place">Texas</span> lawmakers tried to strip away the secretive nature of snitch deals by compelling prosecutors to keep track of and disclose the sort of rudimentary information that defendants and their lawyers are often lacking. This includes a full accounting of the benefits that jailhouse informants have received for their testimony, their criminal records and the previous cases in which they testified. Last year, <span id="mention-628" about="Illinois" class="mention place">Illinois</span> passed legislation that requires judges to hold pretrial “reliability hearings” to evaluate whether informants, in light of the benefits they have been promised and their histories as informants, should be allowed to testify. In July, Connecticut became the first state to enact a statewide tracking system for jailhouse informants that documents where and when such witnesses have previously testified and what benefits they received in return.</p>

	<p>Florida took action after a staggering number of its death-row inmates were exonerated; to date, 29 condemned men have been cleared of their convictions, more than in any other state. A commission appointed by the <span id="mention-561" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> Supreme Court to study wrongful convictions recommended that prosecutors disclose the deals they make with jailhouse informants, and in response, the court changed the rules of criminal procedure in <time datetime="2014">2014</time> to require the disclosure of such deals as well as other details related to the informant. The new requirement was intended to introduce transparency — but in practice, it does not address the common problem that prosecutors may not need to make explicit promises at all, because the potential for leniency is implicit and well understood.</p>

	<p>Reformers hope that new legislation, though imperfect, could still deter prosecutors from relying on jailhouse informants. “When you put reforms in place that require tracking and disclosing information about these witnesses, what often comes to light is a good deal of information that could discourage prosecutors from wanting to move forward,” says <span id="mention-343" about="RebeccaBrown" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Rebecca Brown" data-sort="BrownRebecca" data-wikidata-id="Q3110553">Rebecca Brown</span>, director of policy for the Innocence Project. “Once they have a fuller understanding of all the factors that would underlie that informant’s testimony, they have to confront questions like: Is this reliable enough to move forward with?”</p>

	<p>But in a vast majority of states, no reforms have been passed at all. Perjury charges for jailhouse snitches are very rare, even when their testimony is later proved to have been demonstratively false. So, too, are any meaningful consequences for prosecutors who fail to disclose agreements made with a jailhouse informant at the time of trial, or who mislead juries into thinking that an informant will not receive rewards after testifying, or who conceal facts about a jailhouse informant’s criminal history that might undermine his credibility. No legislation has yet addressed the outsize but largely invisible role that jailhouse informants play in plea deals, in which prosecutors may use the mere specter of an informant’s future testimony to intimidate defendants into not taking their cases to trial. And more radical ideas — like an outright ban on jailhouse informants in capital cases — have stalled, allowing prosecutors to continue using snitch testimony to secure the starkest, most irrevocable punishment.</p>

	<p>On Aug. 7, 1987, five weeks after <span id="mention-344" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">James Dailey</span>’s trial ended in a guilty verdict, the 41-year-old <span id="mention-653" about="Vietnam" class="mention place">Vietnam</span> veteran came to court to be formally sentenced to death. He had remained mute throughout his trial, but that day, he finally rose to speak. Tall and angular, with dark hair and a long, mournful face, he began by recognizing the “terrible kind of pain” <span id="mention-345" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Shelly Boggio</span>’s murder had caused her twin sister, and the anguish felt by her family members, who sat in the courtroom, weeping. “I say these things as a caring human being and as a person wrongfully convicted of this heinous crime,” he declared. He had been condemned by <span id="mention-346" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span>’s “win at all costs” system of justice, he said, in which “truth is allowed to be manipulated and paid liars are allowed to testify.” His trial, he added before he was led away in shackles, had been a “mockery of justice.”</p>

There wasn’t any hiding the fact.”<span class="credit"><span id="mention-349" property="kwic:mentions" about="EliDurst" class="mention person">Eli Durst</span> for The New York Times</span></figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p><span id="mention-350" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>, who was released five days later, was supposed to be back in court that October for his trial on charges of grand theft. But by the time his trial date rolled around, he had skipped town, having absconded with a rented <span id="mention-677" about="LincolnTown" class="mention thing">Lincoln Town</span> Car shortly before he was due to marry a woman who believed he worked undercover for the F.B.I. Prosecutors were left in the lurch; their star witness, who was slated to testify in three coming murder trials, was suddenly a fugitive from justice.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-351" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>, meanwhile, was hiding out in Austin, Tex., where he was busy practicing a sort of absurdist performance art. Passing himself off as “<span id="mention-352" about="JPaulBourne" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="J. Paul Bourne" data-sort="BourneJ.Paul">J. Paul Bourne</span>,” a high roller who was flush with oil money, he managed to buy $27,000 worth of jewelry with forged checks while also running “a new unknown type scam,” according to documents from the Travis County district attorney’s office — a con that involved opening bank accounts on the promise that millions of dollars would be wired in. He also married, and soon divorced, his sixth wife.</p>

	<p>Following his arrest on a forgery charge in <time datetime="1988-02">February 1988</time>, he tried to reprise his role as a snitch, but an assistant district attorney in Austin saw what should have been clear to any prosecutor. <span id="mention-353" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>, she warned in an interoffice memo, “is a BIG con artist.” <span id="mention-354" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was soon extradited back to <span id="mention-563" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span>, where he was booked, once again, into the <span id="mention-355" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span> Jail.</p>

	<p>By then, his relationship with the state attorney’s office had soured, his decision to bolt to <span id="mention-583" about="Texas" class="mention place">Texas</span> having made a farce of the trust it had put in him. But if prosecutors thought they could distance themselves from <span id="mention-356" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>, they had failed to discern the game he was playing. When they balked at his demands for a lenient plea deal in the summer of <time datetime="1988">1988</time>, he turned on them.</p>

	<p>With the help of his public defender, <span id="mention-357" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> filed a motion with the trial court in which he claimed a history of extensive prosecutorial misconduct. In the motion, he asserted that prosecutors had coached him on how to testify in numerous cases so as to give jurors the false impression that he “had actually heard all these ‘confessions,’ and had no agreement with the state for a reward for his testimony.” Prosecutors “knew of the potential questionability of said confessions,” the motion charged. <span id="mention-358" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> provided the names of 11 prosecutors whom he accused of misconduct but provided few specifics. He claimed to have given information or testimony in more than 50 cases and suggested that much of that evidence was tainted.</p>

	<p>Just as the men whom <span id="mention-359" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> leveled outrageous claims against over the years had faced accusations that were maddeningly difficult to disprove, prosecutors found themselves on the defensive, scrambling to discredit what <span id="mention-360" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> claimed was the honest truth. In formal responses submitted to the court, the state attorney’s office categorically denied his assertions, dismissing them as “falsehoods, ranging in degree from gross exaggeration to preposterous fabrication” — a richly paradoxical about-face for an office that had asked scores of jurors to take him at his word. Trying to preserve the integrity of the cases <span id="mention-361" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> had participated in, prosecutors simultaneously argued that his earlier testimony as a state witness “was credible, was often independently substantiated and withstood extensive cross-examination.”</p>

	<p>In fact, behind the scenes, an investigator with the state attorney’s office had difficulty verifying that <span id="mention-362" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> had provided information that could be independently corroborated. Of the two examples Detective <span id="mention-363" about="JohnHalliday" class="mention person">Halliday</span> provided — he said <span id="mention-364" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s tips led law enforcement to a ski mask worn during the committing of a murder and to a gun used in another killing — only the claim about the ski mask checked out; of the other, the investigator wrote: “This information is incorrect. The information from <span id="mention-365" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was accurate; however it came months after the gun was retrieved.”</p>

	<p><span id="mention-366" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> brought forth his grievances, the state attorney’s office told the court, only after he failed to blackmail prosecutors into cutting him a favorable deal. Yet in the end, <span id="mention-367" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> got exactly what he wanted. After <span id="mention-368" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> withdrew his motion claiming that they had engaged in misconduct, he and prosecutors arrived at what appeared to be a mutually beneficial arrangement — one that would both appease <span id="mention-369" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> and send him far from <span id="mention-370" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span>. For a total of six felonies — four counts of grand theft and two counts of failure to appear in court — he would receive a five-year sentence. He entered his plea on the condition that his sentence be served in <span id="mention-584" about="Texas" class="mention place">Texas</span>, where he had time left on a bail-jumping charge.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-371" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> ended up evading even that relatively meager punishment. In <time datetime="1989-11">November 1989</time>, after completing seven months in prison in Huntsville, Tex., on the bail-jumping charge, the State of <span id="mention-585" about="Texas" class="mention place">Texas</span> — which never agreed to allow him to serve his <span id="mention-564" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> sentence there — released him. Ultimately <span id="mention-565" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> abandoned its efforts to extradite him. “The commission has received information which has caused it to conclude that return of said person is not warranted,” read one notably oblique <time datetime="1991">1991</time> <span id="mention-566" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> Parole Commission memo.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-372" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> had been let loose on the world again.</p>

	<p>In <time datetime="1991">1991</time>, <span id="mention-373" about="Anderson" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Misty Anderson" data-sort="AndersonMisty">Misty Anderson</span> was living with her mother and two younger sisters in Friendswood, Tex. — the same town where <span id="mention-374" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> passed himself off as an airline executive in the late 1970s. Her mother, who declined to be interviewed for this article and whose name is being withheld to protect her privacy, wed <span id="mention-375" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> after a short courtship; she did not know that he was already married, much less that she was his eighth wife. (<span id="mention-376" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> married his seventh wife shortly after his release from prison.) Masquerading as a prosperous real estate developer, <span id="mention-377" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> lavished <span id="mention-378" about="Anderson" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Misty Anderson" data-sort="AndersonMisty">Anderson</span>’s mother with gifts: big bouquets of roses, jewelry, even a used Jaguar. He also began sowing division between her and her eldest daughter.</p>

	<p>In his campaign to undermine the 15-year-old, who disliked him from the start, <span id="mention-379" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> accused her of stealing the engagement ring he had given her mother — a ring whose glittering gemstone, he said, was a seven-carat diamond. <span id="mention-380" about="Anderson" class="mention person">Anderson</span>, whose most fervent wish was for her parents to get back together, saw <span id="mention-381" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> as an interloper, and a calculating and tacky one at that. She was stunned when he accused her of stealing the ring, which she suspected was actually set with a cubic zirconium. “He said I’d taken it,” she told me. “He set me up.”</p>

	<p>As punishment, <span id="mention-382" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> grounded <span id="mention-383" about="Anderson" class="mention person">Anderson</span>, insisting that she could be reformed only through a punishing regimen that he ordered her to carry out over her summer vacation, when temperatures soared into the 90s. “Every day I had to dig holes in the ground along our fence line, under the hot sun, with no water,” <span id="mention-384" about="Anderson" class="mention person">Anderson</span> told me. “I was not allowed to shower, not allowed to brush my teeth. I was only allowed to eat once a day. I would get so faint that I would see stars.” When <span id="mention-385" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> permitted her to come inside, she had to stay in her room, shut off from the rest of the world. Only after a month of isolation, when she was at her most desperate and vulnerable, did <span id="mention-386" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> offer her a way out. “He came in my bedroom and said, ‘I have an idea that’s going to make things better between us,’ ” she said.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-387" about="Anderson" class="mention person">Anderson</span> did not speak a word about the sexual abuse that followed — “I didn’t think anyone would believe me,” she explained — until late that summer, when she summoned the courage to confide in a family friend. “She told me that she had to report the abuse, and that’s how it all started,” <span id="mention-388" about="Anderson" class="mention person">Anderson</span> said. The spell <span id="mention-389" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> seemed to have cast over her mother was, in an instant, broken. “As soon as my mother heard what he’d been doing, she called the police,” <span id="mention-390" about="Anderson" class="mention person">Anderson</span> said. <span id="mention-391" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was arrested and charged with sexual assault of a child.</p>

	<p>In the eyes of the law, <span id="mention-392" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was a first-time sex offender. “With a prior conviction for sexual assault of a child, he would have been looking at 25 years to life,” said <span id="mention-393" about="MargaretHindman" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Margaret Hindman" data-sort="HindmanMargaret">Margaret Hindman</span>, the former assistant district attorney in Galveston County who prosecuted him. Instead, he faced two to 20 years. Still, <span id="mention-394" about="MargaretHindman" class="mention person">Hindman</span> pursued him with a vigor that <span id="mention-395" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span> prosecutors had not. She was astonished when I told her of <span id="mention-396" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s long run as a state witness. “This guy clearly was grandiose, delusional and had narcissistic-personality disorder,” she said. “He boasted that he was with the F.B.I., that he was with the C.I.A., and none of it checked out. It’s hard to believe prosecutors relied on him.”</p>

	<p><span id="mention-397" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> professed his innocence, but he pleaded no contest in exchange for a 10-year prison sentence — a deal that was not as harsh as <span id="mention-398" about="Anderson" class="mention person">Anderson</span> would have liked, though it spared her from having to endure a trial. She was in college when <span id="mention-399" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> first came up for parole, and she wrote to the parole board’s members, urging them not to grant him early release, and they abided by her wishes.</p>

	<p>In <time datetime="2002">2002</time>, he was released after serving a decade in prison. Rather than register as a sex offender, as he was required to do by law, he simply disappeared. He was arrested the following year in Middlesex County, Mass., just west of Boston, for larceny and forgery after he stole thousands of dollars from unsuspecting clients who had hired him under the false belief that he was an attorney. He pleaded guilty and served time in state prison, then fled the state around <time datetime="2009">2009</time> after repeatedly violating the terms of his probation.</p>

	<p>He managed to live under the radar for the next six years in East <span id="mention-586" about="Texas" class="mention place">Texas</span>, where he went by the name <span id="mention-400" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">E. Paul Smith</span>. Claiming to be an attorney, an undercover Homeland Security agent, an ex-fighter pilot who had been shot down over <span id="mention-654" about="Vietnam" class="mention place">Vietnam</span> and a terminally ill cancer patient, he worked a variety of small-time scams. “He was writing up people’s wills, and doing legal work for them, and investing their money, though no one ever saw any returns,” said <span id="mention-401" about="ShirleySaathoff" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Shirley Saathoff">Shirley Saathoff</span>, a retired U.S. Marshals senior inspector who began investigating <span id="mention-402" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> in the summer of <time datetime="2015">2015</time> after the daughter of one of his love interests figured out his real name and looked up his criminal record. “He hurt and used a lot of women,” <span id="mention-403" about="ShirleySaathoff" class="mention person">Saathoff</span> added. Everything, even his wedding to a woman named <span id="mention-404" about="JudySmith" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Judy Smith" data-sort="SmithJudy">Judy Smith</span>, who would have been his ninth wife, turned out to be a sham, down to the phony marriage license he had her date and sign. (She is now <span id="mention-405" about="JudyBeaty" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Judy Beaty" data-sort="BeatyJudy">Judy Beaty</span>.) “Paul put just enough truth into a lie to make you believe it,” she told me.</p>

	<p>When law enforcement finally caught up with him that October and arrested him for failing to register as a sex offender, he had over 30 fake IDs in his possession — as well as a framed law-school diploma, a legal dictionary embossed with the words <span id="mention-406" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">E. PAUL SMITH</span>, ESQ., ATTORNEY AT LAW and a handgun. After he was arrested, he asked to speak to law enforcement. “He wanted to cut a deal,” <span id="mention-407" about="JamesFerris" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="James Ferris" data-sort="FerrisJames">James Ferris</span>, an investigator with the Panola County Sheriff’s Department, told me one morning in his tidy office in Carthage, Tex. “He started telling me that he could be useful inside the jail, and I told him I was not interested in speaking with him further.” <span id="mention-408" about="JamesFerris" class="mention person">Ferris</span> was emphatic about why he wouldn’t want to work with <span id="mention-409" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>. “I would never be able to say on the stand that I believed the information he gave me was true and credible.”</p>

	<p>As <span id="mention-410" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">James Dailey</span>’s appeals slowly advanced through the courts, his attorneys at the Capital Collateral Regional Counsel — a state agency that represents indigent death-row inmates — argued that the state had, by putting <span id="mention-411" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> on the stand, used false testimony to convict him. To prove it, they pointed to the claims <span id="mention-412" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> himself made in <time datetime="1988">1988</time>, when he accused prosecutors of knowing that the confessions he recounted were highly suspect and of concealing from juries the rewards he was given for his testimony. But the courts were indifferent. In a <time datetime="2007">2007</time> opinion, the <span id="mention-567" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> Supreme Court noted that <span id="mention-413" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s claims of prosecutorial misconduct had never been substantiated. “<span id="mention-414" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> disavowed the accusations,” read the opinion, and “unequivocally stated that they were false.” The court also accepted the government’s assurances that prosecutors had not engaged in wrongdoing. “The prosecutor in <span id="mention-415" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s case also testified that she believed <span id="mention-416" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s testimony to be truthful at the time of trial,” its justices wrote in their opinion. And with that, any hope of challenging the veracity of <span id="mention-417" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span>’s testimony effectively came to an end.</p>

	<p>Eight years later, in <time datetime="2015">2015</time>, the <span id="mention-568" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> Commission on Offender Review declined to recommend <span id="mention-418" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s case for a clemency hearing. By then, <span id="mention-419" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> and another man, <span id="mention-420" about="JDWalton" class="mention person">J.D. Walton</span>, were the only people <span id="mention-421" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> testified against who remained on death row. <span id="mention-422" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s prospects looked grim; after several rounds of appeals, the inexorable fact of his execution loomed.</p>

	<p>The following year, a new attorney at the C.C.R.C., <span id="mention-423" about="ChelseaShirley" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Chelsea Shirley" data-sort="ShirleyChelsea">Chelsea Shirley</span>, started digging into his case. <span id="mention-424" about="ChelseaShirley" class="mention person">Shirley</span>, who was less than three years out of law school, brought fresh eyes and indefatigable energy to the decades-long case file and the effort to win <span id="mention-425" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> a new trial. At 27, she was younger than the case itself.</p>

	<p>As <span id="mention-426" about="ChelseaShirley" class="mention person">Shirley</span> read the numerous accounts that <span id="mention-427" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s co-defendant, <span id="mention-428" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Jack Pearcy</span>, had given about the night of the crime, she saw nothing to suggest that her client had actually taken part in the murder. “Through the years, <span id="mention-429" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> suggested — but never explicitly said — that he committed this crime by himself,” <span id="mention-430" about="ChelseaShirley" class="mention person">Shirley</span> told me. She was particularly struck by a sworn statement he made to <span id="mention-431" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s attorneys in <time datetime="1993">1993</time>. In it, <span id="mention-432" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> divulged that he had been alone with <span id="mention-433" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span> in the early-morning hours of May 6, 1985, making him the last known person to see her alive; he did not say what happened to <span id="mention-434" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span>, only that he returned home alone. “I went in, got Jim up,” <span id="mention-435" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> said of <span id="mention-436" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>. “I told him, ‘Come on, let’s go smoke a couple joints, drink a beer or something.’ ” He and <span id="mention-437" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> then drove to a nearby causeway, he said, and began tossing a Frisbee around. “He ended up going out in the water,” <span id="mention-438" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> said, “while we was playing Frisbee. We drank beer, we smoked a couple of joints.” His account provided an explanation for why <span id="mention-439" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s jeans were wet when the two men returned home. It was the same story <span id="mention-440" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> had told his attorneys before his own trial — a story they warned him sounded too far-fetched to repeat to a jury.</p>

	<p>On <time datetime="2017-04-20">April 20, 2017</time>, <span id="mention-441" about="ChelseaShirley" class="mention person">Shirley</span> drove to Sumter Correctional Institution in Bushnell, Fla., an hour north of <span id="mention-544" about="Tampa" class="mention place">Tampa</span>, to see <span id="mention-442" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>. She was still in the early stages of her investigation; she did not yet know that she would interview two men who had been incarcerated with <span id="mention-443" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> at different times, who would tell her that <span id="mention-444" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> told them <span id="mention-445" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> had nothing to do with the murder. <span id="mention-446" about="ChelseaShirley" class="mention person">Shirley</span> went to see <span id="mention-447" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> only with the hope that he might be ready, after 30 years, to talk.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-448" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>, a compact, muscular man with penetrating blue eyes, did not seem surprised that she had come to visit him, and he agreed to meet with her. She began by reviewing several previous accounts he had given of the hours surrounding <span id="mention-449" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span>’s murder, in which he suggested that <span id="mention-450" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> was at home when he and the teenager headed out into the night. <span id="mention-451" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> listened and nodded along. Finally he asked if he could look at a document she had placed on the table between them; it was an affidavit she had prepared that summarized his previous statements, but it concluded with a declaration that went one step further. “<span id="mention-452" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">James Dailey</span> was not present when <span id="mention-453" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Shelly Boggio</span> was killed,” it read. “I alone am responsible for <span id="mention-454" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Shelly Boggio</span>’s death.”</p>

	<p><span id="mention-455" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> read the affidavit line by line, and when he finally spoke, his voice was devoid of emotion. “If you can give me a pen, I’ll sign it,” he told <span id="mention-456" about="ChelseaShirley" class="mention person">Shirley</span>. He said that he would be willing to testify in court to attest to the accuracy of the affidavit; he just wanted to tell his mother first, he said, to prepare her. It was an astounding admission — and it was enough, <span id="mention-457" about="ChelseaShirley" class="mention person">Shirley</span> hoped, to win her client a new trial.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-458" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>’s affidavit helped persuade a judge to grant an evidentiary hearing, which was held on Jan. 3, 2018. <span id="mention-459" about="ChelseaShirley" class="mention person">Shirley</span> brought some additional legal firepower. <span id="mention-460" about="LauraFernandez" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Laura Fernandez" data-sort="FernandezLaura" data-wikidata-id="Q83274561">Laura Fernandez</span>, a clinical lecturer and research scholar at <span id="mention-644" about="YaleLawSchool" class="mention organization">Yale Law School</span>, had recently joined <span id="mention-461" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s legal team. She — along with her colleague <span id="mention-462" about="CydOppenheimer" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Cyd Oppenheimer" data-sort="OppenheimerCyd">Cyd Oppenheimer</span>, also a Yale-trained lawyer — would become a driving force in the effort to overturn <span id="mention-463" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s conviction. But when <span id="mention-464" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> was called to the stand, he had a change of heart. He explained that he had spoken to someone with the state — he did not specify whom — and was worried about how his testimony could affect his chances for parole. “I spoke with all my family, and they told me I needed to do what I thought was right, but that I needed to not make a rash decision, since my parole just got denied for seven years,” he said. His family had advised him, he said, to “think about what I was doing.” When questioned about the truthfulness of his affidavit, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The judge denied <span id="mention-465" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s bid for a new trial.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-466" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s lawyers appealed the decision to the <span id="mention-569" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> Supreme Court, citing information they had uncovered that, they argued, warranted a new trial. This included revelations about the other two jailhouse informants, <span id="mention-467" about="PabloDeJesus" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Pablo DeJesus" data-sort="DeJesusPablo">Pablo DeJesus</span> and <span id="mention-468" about="JamesLeitner" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="James Leitner" data-sort="LeitnerJames">James Leitner</span>, who testified against <span id="mention-469" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> in <time datetime="1987">1987</time>. Travis <span id="mention-470" about="JudySmith" class="mention person">Smith</span>, who was incarcerated at the <span id="mention-471" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span> Jail at the same time as the two informants, testified at the evidentiary hearing that he heard them concoct a fictitious story about <span id="mention-472" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>, which they planned to take to prosecutors so they could win reduced sentences. (<span id="mention-473" about="PabloDeJesus" class="mention person">Pablo DeJesus</span> died in <time datetime="2012">2012</time>; <span id="mention-474" about="JamesLeitner" class="mention person">Leitner</span> has never publicly recanted his testimony.) The state attorney’s office’s records reflect that <span id="mention-475" about="PabloDeJesus" class="mention person">DeJesus</span> and <span id="mention-476" about="JamesLeitner" class="mention person">Leitner</span> — who told jurors they would receive no reward for their testimony — haggled with prosecutors for reduced sentences in the months leading up to <span id="mention-477" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s trial, a benefit they were each granted after his conviction.</p>

	<p>But <span id="mention-570" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span>’s highest criminal court was unmoved, finding that <span id="mention-478" about="JudySmith" class="mention person">Smith</span>’s account, and other evidence <span id="mention-479" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s lawyers presented, including proof that <span id="mention-480" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> misrepresented his criminal record at <span id="mention-481" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s trial, had come to light too late. “<span id="mention-482" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> neglects to explain why this information could not have been discovered earlier,” the court stated in an opinion on Oct. 3 — in essence blaming <span id="mention-483" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s lawyers for not uncovering facts that prosecutors had spent years obfuscating.</p>

	<p>It was the end of the road for <span id="mention-484" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>. A week earlier, Gov. <span id="mention-485" about="RonDeSantis" class="mention person" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:person" data-label="Ron DeSantis" data-sort="DeSantisRon" data-wikidata-id="Q3105215">Ron DeSantis</span> had signed his death warrant. “This was one of the most gruesome crimes in the history of <span id="mention-486" about="PinellasCounty" class="mention place">Pinellas County</span>,” <span id="mention-487" about="RonDeSantis" class="mention person">DeSantis</span>, a native of the county who grew up just north of <span id="mention-488" about="Clearwater" class="mention place">Clearwater</span>, later told reporters. “This has been litigated over and over and over, and so at some point you need to do justice.” The day and time of <span id="mention-489" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s death was set: His execution was to be carried out on Nov. 7 at 6 p.m.</p>

	<p>Earlier this fall, I went to see <span id="mention-490" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> in a nursing home in the East <span id="mention-587" about="Texas" class="mention place">Texas</span> town of <span id="mention-651" about="Corsicana" class="mention place">Corsicana</span>. I found him alone in a drab, cluttered room where the blinds were drawn and a television was on low. He had been released from prison in June, after having romanced the mother of another inmate, persuading her to fill his commissary account each week. He lay in bed, shirtless, his thinning gray hair uncombed. Even flat on his back, he cut a shockingly large, Falstaffian figure. He was bedridden and ill — though with what, he did not say. Every so often, nurses turned him so that he did not develop bedsores, and he sometimes grimaced in pain as he spoke. “I think I’m going to die,” he whispered.</p>

	<p>During the afternoon I spent with him, and on a subsequent visit, it became clear that the last person who could provide a deeper understanding of <span id="mention-491" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Paul Skalnik</span> was <span id="mention-492" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> himself. He was a master of misdirection, sidestepping hard questions while portraying himself as the unfairly maligned hero of a story that featured a supporting cast of cunning and vindictive women who were after his riches. Of both charges of child molestation, he insisted that he had been wrongly accused, a victim of girls who lied to the authorities.</p>

	<p>As we talked, I eyed his tattoos. His right shoulder was emblazoned with United States Marines iconography, and his left shoulder bore the words “From <span id="mention-588" about="Texas" class="mention place">Texas</span> to <span id="mention-655" about="Vietnam" class="mention place">Vietnam</span>.” <span id="mention-493" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> told me that the scar on his right knee was a result of being shot down over <span id="mention-658" about="Laos" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Laos" data-wikidata-id="Q819">Laos</span> when he fought in the <span id="mention-656" about="Vietnam" class="mention place">Vietnam</span> War. In fact, his available military records show that he was never on combat duty and never served overseas.</p>

	<p>He insisted that his testimony in <span id="mention-494" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s trial, and in the many other cases he played a role in, had been truthful. “I never lied on the stand,” he told me. “At least to the best of my knowledge.” When I told him of <span id="mention-495" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s impending execution, he was unmoved. But he seemed surprised when I mentioned that <span id="mention-496" about="FreddieGaines" class="mention person">Freddie Gaines</span> — the 24-year-old who stabbed his girlfriend’s ex-lover in a bar brawl — was still in prison, 36 years later. “I think that was a crime of passion,” <span id="mention-497" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> said. “He doesn’t need life,” he added, of <span id="mention-498" about="FreddieGaines" class="mention person">Gaines</span>’s sentence. “I’d give him 10 and let him go home.”</p>

	<p>When I reminded <span id="mention-499" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> that he was the witness whose testimony established premeditation at <span id="mention-500" about="FreddieGaines" class="mention person">Gaines</span>’s trial, he appeared shocked. “This was your testimony, that he had planned this,” I reminded him. “Does that ring true to you? Do you think he told you that?”</p>

	<p>“No!” <span id="mention-501" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> cried. “No.” He shook his head resolutely. But when I later tried to return to his apparent recantation, his tone shifted. There is no statute of limitations on perjury in <span id="mention-571" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> in capital felony cases, and <span id="mention-502" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was reluctant to reverse himself. “I won’t retract what I said,” he told me. “Whatever I testified to was fact.”</p>

	<p>Proudly, he told me more than once, “I never lost a case.”</p>

	<p>A week later, I went to <span id="mention-668" about="FloridaStatePrison" class="mention organization">Florida State Prison</span> in <span id="mention-659" about="Raiford" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Raiford" data-wikidata-id="Q2092769">Raiford</span>, west of <span id="mention-660" about="Jacksonville" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Jacksonville" data-wikidata-id="Q16568">Jacksonville</span>, to interview <span id="mention-503" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>. He had recently caught an unexpected break. On Oct. 23, a <span id="mention-661" about="FederalDistrictCourt" class="mention organization" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:organization" data-label="Federal District Court">Federal District Court</span> judge granted him a limited stay of execution, to provide his newly appointed federal attorneys more time to research and present their appeals.</p>

	<p>Florida State Prison is a monolithic, 1960s-era penitentiary hemmed in on all sides by level farmland and coils of razor wire. It is also home to the so-called death house, where inmates with active death warrants are held in the weeks leading up to their executions. For our meeting, <span id="mention-504" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> was led into the tiny, fluorescent-lit room where final interviews with the condemned are conducted. His hands were manacled to a chain belt at his waist, and his feet were bound by leg irons. At 73, he moved slowly. Behind his thick-framed, prison-issued glasses, he had heavy circles under his eyes.</p>

	<p>Though <span id="mention-505" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> had been granted a stay, it was clear that what lay ahead weighed heavily upon him. He had been convicted in the era of <span id="mention-664" about="OldSparky" class="mention thing" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:thing" data-label="Old Sparky" data-wikidata-id="Q462948">Old Sparky</span>, the straight-backed oak chair in which 240 prisoners went to their deaths before 2000, when the <span id="mention-573" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> Legislature made lethal injection the preferred method of execution. As <span id="mention-506" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> passed days, and then weeks, in the death house, he experienced another, different kind of torment: the anticipation of waiting. His cell was just 30 feet from the execution chamber. At the time of our interview, he had already been measured for his state-issued burial suit.</p>

	<p>After more than three decades in prison, <span id="mention-507" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> seemed even-tempered, agreeable, even acquiescent. A lieutenant at the prison would later take me aside to tell me that <span id="mention-508" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s disciplinary record was almost nonexistent — a feat for anyone who has been incarcerated for so long.</p>

	<p>I asked <span id="mention-509" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> about an observation his mother made when she testified during the penalty phase of his trial, hoping to persuade the jury to show him mercy. “I sent two lovely young men to the Air Force and Marines,” she said of <span id="mention-510" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> and one of his brothers, “and they came back, and they were different boys.” <span id="mention-511" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> closed his eyes at the memory. “I was messed up,” he said. He explained that he was sent to <span id="mention-665" about="BienHoa" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Bien Hoa" data-wikidata-id="Q19316">Bien Hoa</span>, an air base northeast of <span id="mention-666" about="Saigon" class="mention place" property="kwic:mentions" typeof="kwic:place" data-label="Saigon" data-wikidata-id="Q1854">Saigon</span>, in <time datetime="1968">1968</time> during the Tet Offensive; after rocket attacks hit the base, he and other soldiers assisted the injured — men whose limbs had been blown off, their faces ravaged, who drifted between life and death. “I wasn’t built for that,” he told me. “I started drinking real bad.” To sleep, he had to finish as much as a fifth of alcohol. After three tours in <span id="mention-657" about="Vietnam" class="mention place">Vietnam</span>, he found no relief when he returned home. He sank into addiction and became, he told me, “a vagabond.”</p>

	<p>His relationship with <span id="mention-512" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span>, whom he met in a bar in Kansas, was elemental. “We smoked dope together,” <span id="mention-513" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> said simply. He insisted that he had nothing to do with <span id="mention-514" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span>’s murder and that he believed <span id="mention-515" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> was driving <span id="mention-516" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Boggio</span> home when <span id="mention-517" about="JackPearcy" class="mention person">Pearcy</span> left the house with the teenager, and he went to sleep.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-518" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> understood that any chance of proving his innocence was lost when <span id="mention-519" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> took the stand. “I never talked to <span id="mention-520" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Paul Skalnik</span> in my life,” he told me, his voice rising. “We all knew he was an infamous snitch and an ex-police officer. We knew everything about him. We knew how many guys he had snitched on. There wasn’t any hiding the fact. The officers would tell us! The officers that worked in the dang jail, they’d say, ‘Don’t talk to him.’</p>

	<p>“It was impossible for him to get my confession the way he said he got it,” he continued. Even if <span id="mention-521" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> — under protective custody, and a stranger to <span id="mention-522" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>, no less — had somehow managed to strike up a conversation, the distance between the two men would have prohibited any sort of meaningful or intimate discussion. “He would’ve had to holler at me,” <span id="mention-523" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> said. “And I would have had to speak loudly to confess to him.”</p>

	<p><span id="mention-524" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> told me something that he’d thought back to many times over the years: He had been moved from one cell to another shortly before his trial was slated to begin. Jail logs, in which inmates’ cell assignments are recorded, confirm that on May 1, 1987 — just 18 days before <span id="mention-525" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s scheduled trial — <span id="mention-526" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> was moved from the lower G wing of the jail to the upper G wing, where <span id="mention-527" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> was held. “Right away, I told the sergeant, I said, ‘Get me out of here,’ ” <span id="mention-528" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> told me. “ ‘This is a damn setup.’ ” <span id="mention-529" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Skalnik</span> claimed to have elicited <span id="mention-530" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s confession just two days later. Five days after that, he was talking to the state attorney’s office. It was one of many troubling facts that the jury in <span id="mention-531" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s trial never heard.</p>

	<p><span id="mention-532" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span>’s stay of execution will remain in place through Dec. 30. After that, Governor <span id="mention-533" about="RonDeSantis" class="mention person">DeSantis</span> can set a new execution date for as soon as January. When that day comes, <span id="mention-534" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> will be asked to walk from his cell to the execution chamber, where he will lie down on the gurney. Leather restraining straps will be fastened across his body, and an IV line will be inserted into his arm. Finally, the signal will be given to the executioner to begin the flow of lethal drugs. At that moment, the State of <span id="mention-574" about="Florida" class="mention place">Florida</span> will be asking its citizens to trust that <span id="mention-535" about="JamesDailey" class="mention person">Dailey</span> killed <span id="mention-536" about="ShellyBoggio" class="mention person">Shelly Boggio</span> that night beside the dark water, and that he received a fair trial, and that justice has finally been served. It will be asking them, as it has time and time again, to believe the word of <span id="mention-537" about="PaulSkalnik" class="mention person">Paul Skalnik</span>.</p>
